# README

This is where most of my custom scripts reside.
Due to the growing number of them, I started organizing them in sub directories.

## ðŸ“‚ Files & Directories

- `.old`: backup location for custom scripts I stopped using
- `cheat-sh`: custom script and data to interact with [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh)
- `rofi`: my custom rofi menus (power menu, audio source fzf, wallpaper changer, etc.)
- `sqlite`: a small collection of handy QOL scripts for SQLite
- `tmux`: all of my tmux related custom scripts
    - `oskour`: a custom fzf utility to browse documentation (`cheat.sh`, `--help`, `man`, `tldr` and `learnxinyminutes`)
    - other miscellaneous scripts that I use everyday
- `waybar`: custom waybar modules (language and VPN info)
- other miscellaneous scripts that I use everyday
