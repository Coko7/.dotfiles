I did not make all of this myself. A lot of stuff comes from these amazing people:
- [BrodieRobertson](https://github.com/BrodieRobertson/dotfiles): Automatic sourcing of aliases (Youtube: [Brodie Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCld68syR8Wi-GY_n4CaoJGA))
- [Derek Taylor](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles): Offers great advice on how to manage dotfiles (Youtube: [DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg))
- [Phantas0s](https://github.com/Phantas0s/.dotfiles): Solid Zsh setup (without [omz](https://ohmyz.sh/)) and overall nice directory structure (Blog: [The Valuable Dev](https://thevaluable.dev/))
- [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles): Tailored tmux/vim/fzf tools for a highly productive development workflow ([Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ENHE5xdFSwx71u3fDH5Xw), [Youtube 2](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUyeluBRhGPCW4rPe_UvBZQ))
- [typecraft](https://github.com/typecraft-dev/dotfiles): Mainly stole his Hyprland setup (wofi, waybar) (Youtube: [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo71RUe6DX4w-Vd47rFLXPg))
