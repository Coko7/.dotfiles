    - [Qt5ct](https://github.com/desktop-app/qt5ct) for apps that use QT toolkit (KDE apps)

## 🚀 Custom scripts

To have a Linux experience customized to my liking, I rely on a lot of homemade scripts. If you are curious about them, you can take a look there:
- [.config/scripts/](./.config/scripts): scripts intended to be used by other scripts or linked to keybinds
- [.config/local/bin-sh/](./.config/local/bin-sh): custom bash scripts that I intend to invoke directly from the command line

## 🇽 X.Org Server system setup

Before migrating to Wayland, I was using an X-server based config.

## ⌨️ Keyboard setup

I have been using ergonomic keyboards for some years now:

- 60 keys Sofle: [coko7/sofle](https://github.com/coko7/sofle)

- [Derek Taylor](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles): Offers great advice on how to manage dotfiles (Youtube: [DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg))
- [Phantas0s](https://github.com/Phantas0s/.dotfiles): Solid Zsh setup (without [omz](https://ohmyz.sh/)) and overall nice directory structure (Blog: [The Valuable Dev](https://thevaluable.dev/))
- [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles): Tailored tmux/vim/fzf tools for a highly productive development workflow ([Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ENHE5xdFSwx71u3fDH5Xw), [Youtube 2](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUyeluBRhGPCW4rPe_UvBZQ))
- [typecraft](https://github.com/typecraft-dev/dotfiles): Mainly stole his Hyprland setup (wofi, waybar) (Youtube: [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo71RUe6DX4w-Vd47rFLXPg))
